# ☕ Paris Coffee Shop Animation – Blender Project

🎬 Introduction & Motivation

For our final project in the Computer Graphics (CPIT285) course, we set out to create a rich, immersive scene using Blender. Our group was inspired by the idea of a cozy coffee shop nestled in a small Parisian neighborhood—one that evokes nostalgia through the warmth of its atmosphere and the music of Fairouz playing in the background. Our goal was to transport viewers to a place where simple joys—like coffee and donuts—are celebrated, and where the ambiance feels both welcoming and reminiscent of cherished memories.

## 📝 Project Description

On a crisp, cozy autumn day in a quiet Paris neighborhood, a new coffee shop opens its doors. This isn’t just any coffee shop—it’s the first in the area to play Fairouz exclusively, quickly becoming a beloved spot among both Arabs and Americans for its inviting seating, aromatic coffee, and famous donuts.  
Our animation captures the essence of this place:  
- The charming exterior and bustling entrance  
- The enticing display of fresh donuts on the racks, complete with labels  
- Customers relaxing outdoors, enjoying their coffee and desserts  
- The gentle ambiance, enhanced by subtle motion and the timeless sound of Fairouz
